\section*{Supplementary methods}

All analyses were run on \textbf{\textsf{R}}, using the package \texttt{terra} for raster manipulation \citep{Hijmans2024}.

\paragraph{Climate data}
Daily mean temperatures from 1951 to 2020 were extracted from the ERA5-Land dataset, at a 0.1\degree~spatial resolution \citep{MunozSabater2021}. We sampled $>$500 sites on a regular grid across Europe (see Figure 2 in the main text).\\
Following \citet{McMaster1997}, we define growing degree-days at a day d ($GDD_d$) as:
\begin{equation}
GDD_d =
\begin{cases}
    0 & \text{if}~T_d<T_{lower}\\
    T_{upper}-T_{lower} & \text{if}~T_d>T_{upper}\\
    T_d-T_{lower} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}       
\end{equation}

\noindent where $T_d$ is the mean temperature at the day d, and $T_{lower}$/$T_{upper}$ the lower/upper temperature thresholds (defining the range within which metabolism is likely active). Here, we chose $T_{lower}=5$\degree C and $T_{upper}=35$\degree C. 

\paragraph{Optimal period} For each day and each site, environmental predictability was computed as the $R^2$ of the linear regression across years between total GDD and the GDD accumulated by that day (blue panel, \Cref{fig:method}). Growth potential was defined as the remaining GDD to be accumulated from that day until the end of the year (yellow panel, \Cref{fig:method}). While other trade-offs could be considered, this appears to be the most intuitive choice. Both environmental predictability and growth potential were computed for the entire year (January 1 to December 31), although the growing season is likely more restricted and varies across locations. \\
We computed an optimality measure based on the Euclidean distance $D$ from  the ideal point where both predictability and growth potential are maximized (green panel, \Cref{fig:method}). Optimality was defined as $max(D)-D$ (where $max(D)\approx1.414$)---such that higher values correspond to more optimal days. Days were classified as optimal if they felt within the top 10\% of the most optimal days.

\caption{\textbf{The average optimal trade-off between environmental predictability and growth potential is relatively stable across the Holocene.} Daily mean temperatures were obtained from \citet{VanderMeersch2024}, in which daily data were generated with the GWGEN weather generator \citep{Sommer2017} based on monthly paleosimulations from the HadCM3B-M2.1 coupled general circulation model \citep{Armstrong2019}. BP stand for "Before Present" (i.e. 1950).}

\caption{\textbf{The future optimal trade-off between environmental predictability and growth potential (2071-2100)s.} Daily mean temperatures came from the last Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) climate  projections, for 5 global climate models (GCMs) and 2 shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). Model projections were downscaled to a 0.1Â° resolution with a statistical trend-preserving method (the cumulative distribution function transform), using the ERA5-Land reanalysis as a reference observational dataset between 1981 and 2010 \citep{Noel2022}. The five GCMs were GFDL-ESM4, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, MRI-ESM2-0 and UKESM1-0-LL.}
