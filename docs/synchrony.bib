  abstract  = {Climate change is shifting the growing seasons of plants, affecting species performance and biogeochemical cycles. Yet how the timing of autumn leaf senescence in Northern Hemisphere forests will change remains uncertain. Using satellite, ground, carbon flux, and experimental data, we show that early-season and late-season warming have opposite effects on leaf senescence, with a reversal occurring after the year’s longest day (the summer solstice). Across 84\% of the northern forest area, increased temperature and vegetation activity before the solstice led to an earlier senescence onset of, on average, 1.9 ± 0.1 days per °C, whereas warmer post-solstice temperatures extended senescence duration by 2.6 ± 0.1 days per °C. The current trajectories toward an earlier onset and slowed progression of senescence affect Northern Hemisphere–wide trends in growing-season length and forest productivity.},

  abstract  = {High interannual variation in seed production in perennial plants can be synchronized at subcontinental scales with wide consequences for ecosystem functioning, but how such synchrony is generated is unclear1–3. We investigated the factors contributing to masting synchrony in European beech (Fagus sylvatica), which extends to a geographic range of 2,000 km. Maximizing masting synchrony via spatial weather coordination, known as the Moran effect, requires a simultaneous response to weather conditions across distant populations. A celestial cue that occurs simultaneously across the entire hemisphere is the longest day (the summer solstice). We show that European beech abruptly opens its temperature-sensing window on the solstice, and hence widely separated populations all start responding to weather signals in the same week. This celestial ‘starting gun’ generates ecological events with high spatial synchrony across the continent.},

  abstract   = {Temperature and light cues interact to control many biological processes. Experiments give researchers the ability to manipulate these environmental cues independently and can be designed to robustly quantify their individual and interactive effects on any particular biological activity. Such experiments have produced important insights into the environmental controls on numerous biological processes in both plant and animal taxa across terrestrial and aquatic environments. Testing the interactive effects of multiple environmental cues, however, requires experimental treatments to be fully independent; any unmeasured experimental covariation among treatments can result in incorrect conclusions. Using a database of controlled environment experiments on the spring phenology of woody plants as a case study, we highlight how a common experimental set-up, designed to parse the interactive effects of temperature and photoperiod on time to budburst, introduces a latent experimental covariation of these treatments by coupling photo- and thermoperiodicity. Using data simulations, algebraic corrections and a comparative analysis of published experiments, we demonstrate how this unmeasured experimental covariation biases statistical inference regarding the relative contribution of light and temperature cues to phenological variation. We identify this experimental covariation in more than 40\% of published phenology studies that manipulate photoperiod. Our analyses demonstrate that the coupling of thermo- and photoperiodicity results in the overestimation of the effect of photoperiod, the underestimation of forcing effects, and misleading conclusions about their interactions on phenology. This may, in part, explain why the significance of photoperiod cues for spring phenology is currently debated in the literature. Accurate forecasting of how varying environmental conditions will impact the dynamics of biological events requires accurately quantifying cue responses. To this end, we present several options for statistical corrections and alternative experimental designs that can provide more robust estimates of the relative effects of temperature and photoperiod on phenology and many other biological processes controlled by temperature and light.

However, very similar dynamics of cambial activity and wood formation are observed in temperate and boreal zones. • Here, we compared weekly xylem cell production and variation in stem circumference in the main northern hemisphere conifer species (genera Picea, Pinus, Abies and Larix) from 1996 to 2003. Dynamics of radial growth were modeled with a Gompertz function, defining the upper asymptote (A), x-axis placement (β) and rate of change (κ). • A strong linear relationship was found between the constants β and κ for both types of analysis. The slope of the linear regression, which corresponds to the time at which maximum growth rate occurred, appeared to converge towards the summer solstice. • The maximum growth rate occurred around the time of maximum day length, and not during the warmest period of the year as previously suggested. The achievements of photoperiod could act as a growth constraint or a limit after which the rate of tree-ring formation tends to decrease, thus allowing plants to safely complete secondary cell wall lignification before winter.},

  abstract = {Phenotypically plastic characters may respond to multiple variables in their environment, but the evolutionary consequences of this phenomenon have rarely been addressed theoretically. We model the evolution of linear reaction norms in response to several correlated environmental variables, in a population undergoing stationary environmental fluctuations. At evolutionary equilibrium, the linear combination of environmental variables that acts as a developmental cue for the plastic trait is the multivariate best linear predictor of changes in the optimum. However, the reaction norm with respect to any single environmental variable may exhibit nonintuitive patterns. Apparently maladaptive, or hyperadaptive plasticity can evolve with respect to single environmental variables, and costs of plasticity may increase, rather than reduce, plasticity in response to some variables. We also find conditions for the evolution of an indirect environmental indicator that affects expression of a plastic phenotype, despite not influencing natural selection on it.},

  abstract   = {Phenotypic plasticity is a major mechanism of response to global change. However, current plastic responses will only remain adaptive under future conditions if informative environmental cues are still available. We briefly summarize current knowledge of the evolutionary origin and mechanistic underpinnings of environmental cues for phenotypic plasticity, before highlighting the potentially complex effects of global change on cue availability and reliability. We then illustrate some of these aspects with a case study, comparing plasticity of blue tit breeding phenology in two contrasted habitats: evergreen and deciduous forests. Using long-term datasets, we investigate the climatic factors linked to the breeding phenology of the birds and their main food source. Blue tits occupying different habitats differ extensively in the cues affecting laying date plasticity, as well as in the reliability of these cues as predictors of the putative driver of selective pressure, the date of caterpillar peak. The temporal trend for earlier laying date, detected only in the evergreen populations, is explained by increased temperature during their cue windows. Our results highlight the importance of integrating ecological mechanisms shaping variation in plasticity if we are to understand how global change will affect plasticity and its consequences for population biology.

Utilizing data from six plantings of corn over a 2 year period, 22 different methods of computing thermal units were tested for their ability to account for variation in flowering dates. Both hourly and daily temperature data were used in the equations. In general the daily measurements appeared to be approximately as accurate as the hourly measurements. The best equation for predicting flowering dates on the basis of thermal units utilized a base temperature of 10C (50F) and an optimum of 30C (86F). The excess temperature above 30C was subtracted to account for high temperature stress.},

  abstract  = {Climatic warming alters the onset, duration and cessation of the vegetative season. While previous studies have shown a tight link between thermal conditions and leaf phenology, less is known about the impacts of phenological changes on tree growth. Here, we assessed the relationships between the start of the thermal growing season and tree growth across the extratropical Northern Hemisphere using 3,451 tree-ring chronologies and daily climatic data for 1948–2014. An earlier start of the thermal growing season promoted growth in regions with high ratios of precipitation to temperature but limited growth in cold–dry regions. Path analyses indicated that an earlier start of the thermal growing season enhanced growth primarily by alleviating thermal limitations on wood formation in boreal forests and by lengthening the period of growth in temperate and Mediterranean forests. Semi-arid and dry subalpine forests, however, did not benefit from an earlier onset of growth and a longer growing season, presumably due to associated water loss and/or more frequent early spring frosts. These emergent patterns of how climatic impacts on wood phenology affect tree growth at regional to hemispheric scales hint at how future phenological changes may affect the carbon sequestration capacity of extratropical forest ecosystems.},
